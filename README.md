# Car Manager

This project is working off [BYOB - Car Manager](https://github.com/chrisboylen/BYOB-vehicles.git)  
The idea of the project is to serve as an inventory manager for an exotic car dealership. Where you can view, add and delete the current inventory.

Using Firebase realtime database as a backend, I set up a separate client-side application using create-react-app.

Created by [Chris Boyen](https://github.com/chrisboylen "Chris Boyen") and [Joel O'Connor](https://github.com/JoOCon).
