# Car Manager

This project is working off [BYOB - Car Manager](https://github.com/chrisboylen/BYOB-vehicles.git) backend.
The idea of the project is to serve as an inventory manager for an exotic car dealership. Where you can view, add and delete the current inventory.

It is bootstrapped with create-react-app.

Created by [Chris Boyen](https://github.com/chrisboylen "Chris Boyen") and [Joel O'Connor](https://github.com/JoOCon).
